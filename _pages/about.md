Hi! I’m Cansu (pronounced as Jan-Sue) 

I’m a PhD student in the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/) (iSchool) at the University of Toronto where my doctoral research is advised by Dr. Nadia Caidi. 

I work as a teaching associate at the [Institute of Communication, Culture, Information, and Technology](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/iccit/institute-communication-culture-information-and-technology) (ICCIT) and also member of the [Third Space Lab](https://thirdspace.toronto.edu/) directed by Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed in the Department of Computer Science, the University of Toronto. 

I’m as well a member of [Association for Information Science and Technology](https://www.asist.org/)(ASIS&T), [Centre for Refugee Studies](https://crs.info.yorku.ca/) (CRS), and [Design Research Society](https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/home) (DRS). 

Before joining the iSchool, I hold an MA in Media and Communications at [Galatasaray University](https://www.gsu.edu.tr/fr/), and a BA in Political Science and International Relations at [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US).

In between my degrees, I’ve worked as a professional in health insurance industry and non-profit/civic tech spaces. In my spare time, I enjoy poetry, music, swimming, and sharing good stories over food. I tend to put hummus on everything.
